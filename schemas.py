    One normalized claim in the case ledger.

    Conflict detection groups on (subject, predicate, qualifier) only — never on

    timeline by as_of_date (same-date disagreement only). Prefer predicates from
    predicates.py; unknown predicates must be flagged for review
    (needs_predicate_review), not silently accepted.

    subject is a canonical entity id (child, mother, father, school, or a source
    id for provenance) — never a display name.

    assertion is asserted | denied only. Non-assertion (silence, deferral, omission)
    produces no row — there is no not_stated value.

    grade is independent of age and life_stage — never infer one from another.

    valence and source_section are not redundant and must not be collapsed.
    source_section is observed (the literal document heading); valence is the
    queryable dimension — derived from source_section where the heading carries
    valence, and Molly's call where no heading exists. source_section is None
    therefore signals that a cell needed her judgment rather than the document's
