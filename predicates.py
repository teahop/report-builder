"""
Predicate vocabulary for Background & History ledger facts.

Extraction selects from this vocabulary via structured-output enum (plus an
`__unregistered__` escape with proposed_predicate). Unknown proposals route to
predicates_for_review — never silently treated as known.

Predicate class (required for every entry) is what Stage 3 conflict detection
uses instead of domain keywords:

  record        — one true value exists; disagreement means a source is wrong
                  (legal_name, dob, birth_term, allergy_status, grade, …)
  perspectival  — multiple valid viewpoints; disagreement is clinical signal
                  (rating scales, behavioral concerns, interview impressions)

Molly's questionnaire battery (BASC, ASRS, SRS, ABAS, SSIS-SEL) is given to
parent, student, and teacher by design. Rater disagreement on perspectival
predicates must never become a conflict (spec §9.2).

Temporality is a property of the predicate (default_temporality), stamped
server-side after extraction — not chosen per instance by the model.
